  SuperUnityBuild is a Unity utility that automates the process of generating
  builds. It's easy and quick enough to use on small apps, but
  it's also powerful and extensible enough to be extremely useful on larger
  projects. The key to this flexibility lies in SuperUnityBuild's configurable
  degrees of granularity and its BuildActions framework which allows additional
  operations to be added into the build process.
